- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mabandrea
I'm a data enthusiast.
In my first project I have worked on the diabetic dataset from kaggle. I took the first 29 records for analysis.

The diabetes dataset from Kaggle contains information about individuals, and includes features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and diabetes outcome.

In this project, I have done the following analysis:

1. Calculated the number of indoviduals who are diabetic and non-diabetic to understand the distribution of diabetes in the dataset.
2. Calculated the average glucose level for diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
3. Identified the maximum BMI(Body Mass Index) in the dataset.
4. Identified the number of pregnancies for individuals aged 30 or above.
5. Identified individuals whoa are having a BMI(Body Mass Index) greater than 30 and glucose levels above 150.
6. Calculated the average age of diabetic individuals with more than 5 pregnancies.
7. Identified the youngest and oldest individual in the dataset.
8. Identified individuals with missing values for SkinThickness or Insulin.
9. Identified the distribution of blood pressure among diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
10. Identified how the distribution of age differed between the diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
11. Calculated the average Diabetes Pedigree Function value for individuals with and without diabetes.
12. Identified the significant differences in insulin levels between individuals with and without diabetes.
13. Calculated the number of individuals who have a BMI greater than 30, which is classified as "obese" and identified the distribution of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals within this group.
14. Calculated the average age of individuals with the highest and the lowest glucose levels.
15. Identified trends in insulin levels among individuals with different numbers of pregnancies.
16. Calculated the average ae of individuals with a BMI over 30, grouped by the diabetic status.
17. Identified how the distribution of SkinThickness varies between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

The above analysis is done using Postgresql. I have used pgAdmin 4 to execute the queries.
I have attached the pdf which contains the answers to all the above analysis.
