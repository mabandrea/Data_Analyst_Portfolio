- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mabandrea
I'm a data enthusiast.
In my first project I'm going to be working on the Box office revenue of movies.
I have taken the dataset from kaggle which contains the Top_Hoghest_Openings of Hollywood Movies from the last few years.
I will be analyzing the revenue made by these movies.
